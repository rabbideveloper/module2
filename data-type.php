/*
 * PHP OPERATORS
 *
 *
 * PHP Operators is a symbol i.e used to perform operations on operands. In simple words, operators
 * are used to perform operations on variables or values.
 */



/*
 * ==========Arithmetic Operators===========
 * 1. + Addition -> $a + $b Sum of operands
 * 2. - Subtraction -> $a - $b Difference of operands
 * 3. * Multiplication -> $a * $b Product of operands
 * 4. / Division -> $a / $b Quotient of operands
 * 5. % Modulus -> $a % $b Remainder of operands
 * 6. ** Exponentiation $a ** $b $a raised to the power $b
 */


/*
 * ============BITWISE OPERATORS=============
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *  & And  $a & $b Bits that are 1 in both $a and $b are set to 1, otherwise 0;
 *  || Or (Inclusive or) $a || $b Bits that are 1 in either $a or $b are set to 1;
 * ^ Xor (Exclusive or) $a ^ $b  Bits that are 1 in either $a or $b are set to 0;
 * ! Not !a Bits that are 1 set to 0 and bits that are 0 are set to 1;
 * << Shift Left $a << $b Left Shift the bits of operand $a $b steps;
 * >> Shift Right $a >> $b Right Shift the bits of $a operand by $b number of place;
 */

/*
 * ============Assignment Operator==============
 *
 *
 *
 *  = Assign $a = $b The value of right operand is assign to left align;
 *  += Add then assign $a += $b Addition same as $a = $a + $b;
 *  -= Subtract then assign $a -= $b Subtraction same as $a = $a - $b;
 *  *= Multiply then assign $a += $b Multiply same as $a = $a * $b;
 *  /= Divide then assign $a /= $b Find quotient same as $a = $a / $b;
 *  %= Divide then assign (remainder) $a %= $b Find remainder same as $a = $a % $b;
 */


/*
 * ================Comparison Operator=================
 *
 *
 *
 * == Equal $a==$b Return TRUE if $a is equal to $b;
 * === Identical $a === $b Return TRUE if $a is equal to $b, and they are same data type;
 * !== Not identical $a !== $b Return TRUE $a is not equal to $b, and they are not same data type;
 * != Not equal $a != $b Return TRUE $a is not equal to $b;
 * <> Not equal $a <> $b Return TRUE $a is not equal to $b;
 * < Less than $a < $b Return TRUE if $a is less than $b;
 * > Greater than $a > $b Return TRUE if $a is greater than $b;
 * <= Less than or equal $a <= $b Return TRUE if $a is less than or equal $b;
 * >= Greater than or equal $a >= $b Return TRUE if $a is grater than or equal $b;
 * <=> Spaceship $a <=> $b
 *     Return - 1 if $a is less than $b;
 *     Return - 0 if $a is equal $b;
 *     Return - 1 if $a is greater than $b;
